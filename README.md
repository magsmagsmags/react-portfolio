# React Portfolio

## Summary

This portfolio is created using React. It will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Business Context

A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

WHEN viewing their portfolio

THEN they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories
